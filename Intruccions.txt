 For the csaes it fails to start:
 yarn start-storybook --no-manager-cache
 

To make storybook needs to compile typescript into stories it can understand (also adds webpack, etc):

(in packages/react folder)
yarn add --dev @storybook/preset-typescript

Storybook needs babel-loader, also in packages/react
yarn add --dev babel-loader

To see the source code:
yarn add --dev @storybook/addon-storysource

To add the knobs
yarn add --dev @storybook/addon-knobs

To check accessibility:
yarn add --dev @storybook/addon-a11y


Normally we would use yarn publish (or some like that) but in this case we have a monorepo with multiple packages

To make the packages public for Lerna:
"publishConfig": {
    "access": "public"
  }
  
Playground no need to be public, just for testing

To send to NPM:
npm login


For conventional logs in the commits (??):
yarn add --dev commitizen cs-conventional-changelog -W

-W means it's package for the top route, not for the "workspace"
